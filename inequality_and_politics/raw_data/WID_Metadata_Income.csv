The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income.

Surveys are available for the following years: 1994, 2001, 2006, 2009. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2017 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.;"[URL][URL_LINK]http://wid.world/document/cgm2019-full-paper/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Chancel, Cogneau, Gethin & Myczkowski (2019), How large are African Inequalities?
